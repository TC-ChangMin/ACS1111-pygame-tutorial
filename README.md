## ACS1111- Pygame and Learning OOP Concepts

From the assignment instructions:
- Pygame uses OOP. The Pygame modules contain several classes that you will use to create instacnes that perform functions in your pygame applications.
- Sprite - This is a pygame base class used to display things on the screen. You'll subclass it to make your specialized game objects.
- Inheritence - A core feature of OOP. You'll use inheritence to create sepcialized classes from baseclasses.
- Group - Group is a pygame class used to manage groups of Sprites. You'll it's methods and properties work with the Sprites you create.
- Polymorphism - You'll be subclassing the Sprite class to make new game objects. These will be contained in Groups. You'll be processing Sprites in Groups. Polymorphism will allow this to happen.
- Game Loop - The Game Loop is a block of code that runs each time the screen is updated. The Game Loop is an important part of Game and software development in general. In many environments it's integral and you won't work with it directly. In your pygame project the game loop is responsible for updating the position of all of your game objects, checking for collisions, and handling events. These things need to be handled each time the game updates the screen which is typically 30 to 60 times per second.
- Cartesian Coordinates - The games you create with pygame will draw on a 2d grid of pixels. Understanding this coordinate system is important positoning game elements on the screen.

## Learning Objectives
- Create Classes
- Create Sub classes
- Describe Abstract classes
- Use inheritence
- Describe inhertience
- Use Cartesian coordinates

## Personal Touches
- I was allowed to change the sprites and make the game my own, so I added sound effects and animated images.
- I also would flip some images depending on the direction it was spawning from.
- Implemented a stun for 2 seconds while you encounter david martinez because its lore accurate
- Player gets 3 lives before game ends 
  
## Language Used
- Python
